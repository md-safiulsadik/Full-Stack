        Instant noodles, or instant ramen, is a type of food consisting of noodles sold in a precooked and dried block with flavoring powder and/or seasoning oil. The dried noodle block was originally created by flash-frying cooked noodles, which is still the dominant method used in Asian countries; air-dried noodle blocks are favored in Western countries.

        <li>Boil some water. Add two or three cups (.5-.7 liters) of water to a kettle or saucepan. Place the kettle or saucepan over your stove on medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Prepare your ramen. First, pull the lid of the ramen cup back halfway. Remove any seasoning packets.</li>
        <li>Pour in boiling water. Once the water has boiled and your noodle cup has been prepared, pour the water into the cup. Add enough water to reach the “fill” line on the inside of the cup.</li>
        <li>Let it sit and cook. Once the water has been added, press the lid back into place. Usually, the noodles should sit undisturbed for three to five minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir and enjoy. After the three minutes are up, peel off the lid of the noodle cup. Use chopsticks or a fork to stir the noodles and break them apart. If the noodles are steaming, let the cup sit open for a minute or two. </li>
